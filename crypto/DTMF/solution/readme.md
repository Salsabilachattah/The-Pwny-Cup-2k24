Hello there,
Letâ€™s dive into the challenge titled "Hangup". This challenge revolves around DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) signals, commonly associated with telephone dialing. The audio provided contains tones that, when decoded using tools like [DTMF Decoder](https://dtmf.netlify.app/), lead us to a hidden flag. The key insight lies in the hint within the DTMF sequence itself. After extracting the tones using a DTMF decoder, we obtained a hexadecimal string: 503C3932543965395664313850549538563199.
Now we need to brute force and test different Permutation of digits from [1 to 9] and decode them using the script provided in bruteforce.py .
this reveals the message "pleaseGetChipsWithU".

Therefore, the final flag is formatted as shellmates{pleaseGetChipsWithU}.
