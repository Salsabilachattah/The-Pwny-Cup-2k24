# Challenge: BABY ZKP

## Write-up

The challenge is based on a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) that generates states using a random seed initialized with the current time (time.time()). Our task is to interact with the verifier and prove that we know the seed without revealing it. The key idea is that, once we know the seed, we can predict all future states generated by the LCG and solve the challenge.

### Solution Steps:

1. Initializes the random seed using time.time() and verify that value using the provided b value.

2. Generates random numbers using an LCG-like formula to pass all the rounds of the challenge.
